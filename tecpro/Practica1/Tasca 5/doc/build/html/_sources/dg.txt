Descripció general
==================

This project is based on the treatment of pictures using Python. It's organised in modules and everyone does his particular function. 
The program recieves a picture and convert it to a matrix using algorithms, what simplify this procedure. 
Firstly it convert the picture from RGB to B&W and then using the differents functions of our modules(cut,split,compare...) the program identify the different numbers comparing them with the patrons. And returns the numbers in string format.
